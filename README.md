# Books Repository

This repository contains a structured, categorized database of books I have read, am reading, or plan to read. The books are organized into folders by topic, and each folder contains a `metadata.toml` file with details about the books in that category.

## Structure
- Each category has its own folder (e.g., Biotech, Programming, Finance&Markets, etc.).
- Each folder contains a `metadata.toml` file listing books and their metadata (title, author, year, status, notes).
- PDF files are not included in the repository, only metadata and organizational files.

## Example Categories
- Biotech
- Programming
- Electronics
- Finance&Markets
- Semiconductors
- Miscellaneous
- Math&Science
- Automation&Measuring

## How to Use
- Browse the folders to explore books by category.
- View or edit the `metadata.toml` files to update your reading list or add notes.
